 About M7 Health
M7 Health is a nursing workforce management platform built to meet the evolving needs 
of the modern nurse—flexibility, predictability, and autonomy. Our software intelligently 
optimizes labor distribution across hospital units and time, factoring in staff 
preferences, historical volume, and staffing data. The result: dynamic scheduling that 
drives both operational efficiency and staff satisfaction.
M7 is currently live in over 30 hospitals nationwide, with many more onboarding. 
Already, M7 has demonstrated measurable impact—improving nurse retention, 
reducing administrative burden, and lowering excess labor costs.
We recently closed a $10M Series A led by top-tier investors including Threshold 
Ventures, First Round Capital, 25M Health, Lakehouse Ventures, Banter Capital, 
and January Ventures—and we’re just getting started.
 About the Role
We’re looking for a Software Engineer to help us build tools that redefine how hospitals 
manage nursing staff. You’ll be a core contributor to the platform—designing features 
end-to-end, refining our proprietary scheduling system, optimizing real-time algorithms, 
and collaborating across teams to solve complex, real-world problems.
You’ll work closely with product managers and healthcare operations experts to turn 
user needs into intuitive and impactful software—used every day by nurses and hospital 
administrators.

to understand user needs and translate them into practical solutions.
• Maintain Quality: Write clean, well-tested, and maintainable code. Support team 
productivity through code reviews and best practices.
• Think Beyond the Code: At our stage, everyone contributes beyond their job 
description—whether it’s solving customer challenges or refining team processes.
 About You
• Startup Energy: You thrive in fast-paced environments, manage ambiguity well, and 
focus on what moves the needle.

experienced with:
• Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite

effectively across technical and non-technical teams.
